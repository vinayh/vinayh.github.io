My academic interests are:

* Computational neuroscience (biologically-plausible computational models)
* Computer science and software engineering (machine learning algorithms, software tooling and open-source ecosystems, functional programming, algorithm theory)

I'm currently trying to learn more about a myriad of areas in neuroscience and mathematics.

Other interests include:

* Transportation and urban planning
* Linguistics (phonetics, evolutionary)
* Animal rights advocacy
* Running
* Vegan cooking and baking
* Open-source software development

I currently live in Zürich, Switzerland, where I study computational neuroscience at the ETH Zürich/University of Zürich. Please see the [CV page](/cv) for a more formal and complete description of my experiences.
