- Tried systemd-resolved, had issues with leaking to 53

- Tried stubby, had issues with speed as it doesn't cache by itself

- Decided to use unbound, which works except it can't bind to ::1 port 53 (ipv6 loopback port 53) on my machine for some reason so I set it to only listen on 127.0.0.1:53 which still allows it to serve ipv6 addresses

- Make sure to mention /etc/resolv.conf along with immutable flag and config in /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf
