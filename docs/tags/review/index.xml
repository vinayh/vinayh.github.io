        <description>This is a review of Submission (originally Soumission in French), written by Michel Houellebecq and translated by Lorin Stein. I originally wrote this review on May 2, 2020 immediately after reading the book, when it was posted to Goodreads.
First of all, I think this book was surprisingly captivating, almost always readable despite a bit of slow going through some of the passages filled with names in French literature I was unfamiliar with.</description>
